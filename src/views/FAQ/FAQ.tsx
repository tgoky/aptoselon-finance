              <span>
                aptoselon is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a rebasing mechanism to raise funds for a treasury managed by the community. The
                community can then use those funds via aptoselon governance to build out the protocol.

                APTOSELON is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and
                programmable finance. APTOSELON is the governance token for the aptoselon protocol. Using token voting, aptoselon holders have direct influence over the
                APTOSELON treasury and direction of the protocol. Governance discussions take place on Discord and the{" "}

              <span>
                Before the aptoselon community voted to disable the rebasing / elastic supply function, every positive rebase, the treasury mints 5% of the
                rebase amount and sells APTSELON to the APTELON/APT Liquidswap pool. The ETH acquired through this action is sent to the treasury which is
                managed by APTOSELON holders. The current treasury value can be seen on aptoselon.finance.

              <span>
                December 29th, 2020 the aptoselon community has voted to disable the rebasing / elastic supply function of aptoselon and the scaling factor of aptoselon
                has been fixed at 2.50. aptoselon initially as an experiment has evolved into a launch pad for DeFi projects supported by a community
                governed treasury. aptoselon is currently developing multiple projects including Umbrella (Smart Contract Insurance), Degenerative.Finance
                (Synthetics) and aptoselon DAO Set (Set Protocol DAO Investment fund). All of which will generate revenue for aptoselon. For most current
                projects, please visit us in discord.

            <Question active={activeSlug === "govlp"} question="Can LPs participate in governance?" slug="govlp">
              <span>
                Only LPs that are staked in the Incentivizer contract can participate in governance. Voting power is determined by distributing the
                voting power of aptoselon held in the APTELON/APT LiquidSwap pool, but distributed to only aptoselon Incentivizer stakers. This was done to mitigate
                flashloan threats in voting, so the Incentivizer contract keeps a record of the necessary values at needed block heights to facilitate
                those mitigations.
